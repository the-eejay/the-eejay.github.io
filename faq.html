				<h3 class="title">Q: I can't open the file</h3>
				<p>A: Check your system firewall settings/ allow to open no certified downloaded file</p>
				
				<h3 class="title">Q: What would happen if I shoot on my teammate?</h3>
				<p>A: Then your teammate will take damage. Friendly fire is always on, promoting collaboration within the team, limiting the ability for a player to just go in guns blazing.</p>
				
				<h3 class="title">Q: What's the maximum number of players per server?</h3>
				<p>A: At the moment, up to four people, although this could be increased in the future</p>
				
				<h3 class="title">Q: Why doesn't my health bar start at full when I pick the Magpie or the Pelican?</h3>
				<p>A: Within the three ships, the Penguin has the most health at 150hp, and the health bar is representative of that, meaning that the maximum health a player can have is 150. Therefore, playing as the other two ships with less health, the health bar begins at less than the max limit eg. when playing as the Pelican, the health bar with only be half full as the ship has half the health of the Penguin</p>
				
				<h3 class="title">Q: What can I do with the cash I earned?</h3>
				<p>A: You can upgrade your ship. Just click on the upgrade button when you have enough cash to automatically upgrade to your ship</p>
