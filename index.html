				<center><h2>Welcome to SpaceCOG</h2></center>
				<center><h2>Executive Summary</h2></center>
				<p>SpaceCOG is a space themed online collaborative game with a retro theme and arcade style combat. The objective of the game is for players work together to liberate an allied planet in the middle of the map by fighting and surviving against wave after wave of enemies and scoring as many points as possible while doing so. Players will also earn cash as long as they survive to upgrade their weapons. There are three different player ships to choose from before starting a game and two enemy types to encounter in-game. </p>
				<p>SpaceCOG was developed for PC, Mac, Linux and is compatible with most Web browsers, making it possible for friends to connect and play across several platforms. It is played using the keyboard and mouse. Alongside singleplayer, SpaceCOG features a multiplayer mode that allows you to quickly set up games online with friends by removing the need for players to set up accounts or log in.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >The Client</h3></center>
				<p>The game concept was first pitched by Craig McNamara, a web and UX developer/designer, and a proposal was created around his ideas. Which were to have a collaborative game where not everyone could win.</p>
				<p>However; after receiving the brief that was created previously around Mr. McNamaras’ concept, which was also accompanied with a prototype, the team decided that, on top of being too complicated, it was not an ideally ‘fun’ game. The team scheduled a meeting with the client, Mr. McNamara, where the problems found were brought up and discussed. Mr. McNamara gave permission for the project to be broken back down to his core ideas and a new game built back up around them from scratch. This brought the team to create what is now SpaceCOG.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Context of Use</h3></center>
				<p>SpaceCOG is a game, and as such would generally be used in more casual situations involving gaming with friends or by yourself. Due to its flexibility with platforms, the game could be played almost anywhere so the location of use is not specific. The game has potential to be involved in situations where playing the game could become more than casual, such as, a competition between teams.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Documentation Overview</h3></center>
				<p>The following documentation consists of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Supporting material such as guides that help the user to install and play the game</li>
					<li>Frequently asked questions and answers the team found from problems and issues that arose during the design, development and testing phases of the game</li>
					<li>Functional testing results as well as a user evaluation report with results from testing the game with various users</li>
					<li>Supplementary material that was created</li>
					<li>A critical evaluation report that outlines the learning experience for the team, strategies and techniques used during design and development and some reflection on the project as a whole</li>
				</ul>
