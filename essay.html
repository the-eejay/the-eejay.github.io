				<h4>Return Brief</h4>
				<p>The original brief presented by Craig McNamara was a game with only two requirements; it must be collaborative and multiplayer, and the map must be procedurally generated at the beginning of the game. ‘Collaborative game’ was defined as a game where all players could lose, but not all players could win. Players could be competitive to win, however this could lead to a collective loss.</p>
				<p>Additionally, some optional features were suggested; the ability to allow 4-8 players to play together, a ‘pause’ functionality that allowed them to resume the game later, and a game concept suggestion. Coupled with the brief, Daredevil Gaming was supplied a proposal built by the DECO3800 team which adhered to these requirements.</p>
				<h4>Project Goals</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Develop a fun and engaging game with a consistent theme as a polished package ready for market release and to client.</li>
					<li>Synthesise suitable marketing material to promote the product for a tradeshow environment.</li>
					<li>Deliver a final product demonstration to a professional standard to peers, client and examiners in a public exhibition.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Roles</h4>
				<p> After a team discussion, Daredevil Gaming decided on these roles as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Scott Bilkey</strong> - 3D Modeller, Sound Engineer</li>
					<li><strong>Ethan Christie</strong> - Project Lead, Programmer</li>
					<li><strong>Chan-Yeop Jeong</strong> - Database Engineer, UX Tester</li>
					<li><strong>Yuchen Han</strong> - UI Design, UX Tester</li>
					<li><strong>Alan Murtagh</strong> - Programming Lead, Networking Engineer</li>
					<li><strong>William Wilesmith</strong> - UX Lead, UI Design, Programmer</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The designated roles were used more as a guideline than a strict rule as input was encouraged across all areas.</p>
				
				<h4>Project Management</h4>
				<p>Design documents, UI Mockups and documents for the Return Brief, UX Profile and Tech Spike were all uploaded to a shared folder on Google Drive. To host the codebase, the team used a GitHub repository located at <a href="https://github.com/the-eejay/daredevilgaming" >https://github.com/the-eejay/daredevilgaming</a>. All communication was performed through a private group on Facebook.</p>
				
				<h4>Changes to Project</h4>
				<p>After the initial briefing, the team decided that while the proposal generated was a solid and strategic game, it was not likely to perform well in an exhibition setting due to its slow and strategic gameplay. We then discussed this with Craig, and he was more than happy for us to develop our own game and disregard the proposal. Moreover, he was happy for us to follow the original brief as loosely as we wanted.</p>
				
				<h4>Initial Scope Proposal</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>A top-down multiplayer 2D space shooter to be built as a stand-alone application in Unity</li>
					<li>A team of ~4 players sets out on a mission in space, fed by another game, initially proposed to be developed as a 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate)</li>
					<li>The team would have to complete the mission in order to get a reward, set and paid by a player in the 4X game. However, the bounty was shared by living players only</li>
					<li>After the mission, if a reward was obtained, a player would be able to spend it in order to make their character stronger</li>
					<li>‘Friendly fire’ would be enabled to allow a player to kill their team mates and gain a larger portion of the bounty. However, this would risk not having enough power to complete the mission and not getting any reward at all. Additionally, if the person backstabbing their team mate were to survive, they would likely be weakened by the resulting return fire, if any, and potentially be at more risk of being backstabbed themselves</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Deadlines and Group Rules</h4>
				<p>To ensure the minor deliverables would be completed on time for the UX Profile and the Tech Spike, we ensured that all work was completed and ready to be compiled together two days before the due date (Wednesday 11.59pm), to give time for proof-reading, editing, compilation and submission. For the Return Brief, the deadline was set at midnight the night before the due date (Thursday 11.59pm) and was changed going forward because we found that this did not give sufficient time for editing and compilation.</p>
				<p>To ensure the final product would be completed on time, we imposed weekly ‘stretch goals’ that described a substantial update such as ‘Make a simple asteroid shooter’ or ‘Have multiplayer working’ and consisted of several small tasks to achieve it. These deadlines were to be completed by our tutorial time on Friday, 2pm.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Results</h3></center>
				<h4>Minor Deliverables</h4>
				<p>Within the first six weeks of the project, we were to complete three deliverables in order to help us understand what we could and wanted to achieve; in order of completion: Return Brief, UX and Tech Spike. On one hand, they helped us get started and thinking about our goals and what we wanted to achieve, but on the other, we found that it took a lot of time away from development. If we could change it for next time, we would complete the Tech Spike before the UX Profile. The reasons are twofold: we would have started development earlier, potentially completing more features, and we would have a prototype ready for the users to test to generate better content for the testing section UX Profile.</p>
				
				<h4>More changes to Project</h4>
				<p>Shortly after the Tech Spike document was delivered and a discussion with our client, we decided on a new, narrower scope.</p>
				
				<h4>New Scope Proposal</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>20 Waves of enemies with increasing difficulty spawn and attack the player(s)</li>
					<li>The game will pause after every 5 waves and players can purchase randomly generated upgrades</li>
					<li>After the last wave, the player(s) must defeat a single, difficult enemy (boss)</li>
					<li>If a player dies during a round, they must purchase a new ship. If they cannot afford it, they do not win even if their team does</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Final Product</h4>
				<p>Our final product, SpaceCOG, is a fast-paced, retro-style arcade shooter that provides a player an effortless way to start right away or play with friends. It boasts challenging, frantic and fun gameplay that is rewarding and exciting. It was essentially designed as a proof-of-concept example of a single mission that would be played in the game designed in our initial proposal.</p>
				
				<h4>Features we removed</h4>
				<p>We envisioned an exhibition setting to allow a player to get into the action straight away. We felt that we could make that exhibition setting experience better with the changes outlined in our new proposal by not wasting precious development time on features such as persistent character progression that our exhibition users were not likely to use or appreciate.</p>
				<p>We consider this decision a large success, as the bulk of our limited development time was then spent on the gameplay rather than the “meta-game” around it. We guess that our game would have had fewer features and/or more bugs if we did not make this decision, which would have taken a large amount away from the user experience at the exhibit. Also, there is no reason that the features we took out could not be added in the future.</p>
				<p>We also did not include the in-game upgrade feature due to time constraints of the project, or a boss fight because the game was already sufficiently challenging. To our client’s request, our upgrade feature simply changes the colour of the player’s bullet.</p>
				
				<h4>Features we added</h4>
				<p>To allow for some replayability, we chose to add three different types of characters for the players to choose from. These included the Magpie, with more firepower, the Pelican, with more speed but low health, and the Penguin with low speed but high health. This allowed for users to experiment with the different ships to find the ship (or combinations of ships in a team) that worked best for them.</p>
				
				<h4>Project goal look-back</h4>
				<p>We consider our initial goals to be met with huge success. From our extensive user testing, and reactions from users at the exhibit, it is clear that our game is fun, engaging and polished. One team played five times to beat the game and discussed strategy in between failed attempts. Additionally, our client was very happy with it, and gave us two great big thumbs up.</p>
				<p>Our marketing material for promotion at the exhibition was very suitable, and helped us to deliver our demonstration to a highly professional standard to our peers, client and examiners.</p>
				
				<h4>Design Techniques and Skills used</h4>
				<p>Throughout the course of this project, the team used an iterative and incremental software development process in which the team held weekly meetings outlining tasks for each week’s sprint, and reviewing the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed. Additionally, we would demonstrate the completed work to the client and tutors for feedback. This development process was largely a success, as it enabled us to see new work being developed on the project every week, and the work space.</p>
				<p>The process could have been improved by outlining a “definition of done” earlier in the project timeline to determine whether an item was complete, for example, task is implemented in the master branch and doesn’t break the project. This would have alleviated some setbacks with some tasks being delivered in an inconsistent manner e.g. work being uploaded to the cloud while the team expected it to be implemented in the repository. However, after this instance, a DoD was outlined and the development process was much more streamlined.</p>
				
				<h4>New skills gained by team members</h4>
				<center><img src="Website/images/text2mindmap.jpg" alt="mind map" width="1200"/></center>
				
				<h4>Was the plan for project management followed?</h4>
				<p>The plan for project management was mostly followed. The use of Google Drive to upload documents was effective as it allowed us to collaborate and get feedback while writing them. The usage of a GitHub repository to host the code base was also extremely practical in allowing team members to implement different features at the same time without compromising the integrity of the project by preventing overwrites. Additionally, the evolution of the codebase was easily tracked to allow for recovery in the event of an emergency.</p>
				<p>The strategy of using Facebook to communicate was appropriate as we had external commitments that prevented us from having additional full-team meetings outside of class time.  The lead programmer was not available to meet during the Monday contact time due to class clashes.  As a result, an extra meeting time was set aside to update him on any issues from the relevant team members that he would be working with that week.</p>
				<p>The use of the Facebook group allowed for the team to interact informally and check in with their progress updates without the need of writing a formal e-mail or meeting face-to-face.  To improve the effectiveness of this approach, we could have enforced rules on frequency of posts and response time.</p>
				<p>There were no rule breaches from the team’s charter and all work was completed to a professional standard in a timely manner.  Team members asked for help when they were faced with difficulties and the team resolved these issues by assigning someone with the relevant skill set to assist them.</p>

				<p>We consider our presentation at the exhibition a large success.  Our setup included 3 personal laptops and one Dell computer, which was soon switched out to a fourth laptop due to network issues on the day.</p>

				<center><img src="Website/images/projector.jpg" alt="projected game" width="600"/></center>
				<p>We had a cool leaderboard set up on the whiteboard which we observed to bring out a competitive streak in some players.  We made sure that everyone who played got their name up on the wall and a small (edible) prize.  This gave users a sense of achievement and the ability to see how they compared to others.</p>

				<p>Near the end of the day, one team tried five times before they finally won the #1 prize, the MVP cup.</p>
