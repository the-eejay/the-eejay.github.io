				<center><h2>User Evaluation Report</h2></center>
				<p>The primary goal of this user evaluation test is to find out the accessibility of the game and usability of the game. To get the best results, the test requires several users to trial it, and was conducted with 5 users. They all have different experience with playing video games. In that way, the results will be fair to everyone.</p>

				<p><strong>Alex</strong> – As a gamer, I have a high performance computer at home. So, I could run the game smoothly although, the graphic setting was maximum.</p>
				<p><strong>Jack</strong> – I am using under 1000 dollars’ worth laptop. I have no problem with running the game, but the computer starts to get hotter the longer I play the game.</p>
				<p><strong>Tim</strong> – I can run the game when the graphic setting is medium. If any higher than that, the game starts to get pixelated.</p>
				<p><strong>Andy</strong> – The game can be run smoothly, only in condition where the graphic setting is medium.</p>
				<p><strong>Lina</strong> – Perhaps due to my computer’s compatibility, the game is not running smoothly in highest graphic settings. It also lags a bit when the enemies spawn around me.</p>
				<p><strong>Average Points</strong> – 1</p>
				<p><em>User feedback on compatibility (Recommendations):</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Average computers can run the game smoothly when not on the highest graphical setting</li>
					<li>It is suggested that the product should mention that medium graphic setting is highly recommend in the tutorials or in the setting up guide</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>Observations:</em></p>
				<p>This test was designed to see whether average computers run the game smoothly or not. Therefore, consumers do not have to worry about if their computer can handle the game. Three of the users seemed to be worried when the graphic setting reached maximum. However, in most of game time, the game was running smoothly.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Functionality of game</h3></center>
				<p>Q. Did you find that features in the game were easy to use/control?</p>

				<p><strong>Alex</strong> – Most features were easy to use. I used all features except for the upgrade feature. I was busy with playing game, and forgot it was there a lot of the time.</p>
				<p><strong>Jack</strong> – All features were intuitive, so I was able to play the game without any tutorials.</p>
				<p><strong>Tim</strong> – I could not see health bar of my ship properly at the beginning of the game, due to location of the bar.</p>
				<p><strong>Andy</strong> – I had no problem with controlling ships and shooting bullets. However, I did not know how to change space ships until someone told me.</p>
				<p><strong>Lina</strong> – In the perspective of non-gamer view, all features were fairly intuitive, but I think players will have no problem with using features if they read the tutorials.</p>
				<p><strong>Average Points</strong> – 1.6</p>
				<p><em>User feedback on functionality of the game (Recommendations):</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>The health bar should be moved to top, so it becomes more visible</li>
					<li>Upgrade can be removed. Too busy with playing</li>
					<li>Add tutorial mode for beginners</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>Observations:</em></p>
				<p>This test was designed to see whether players can use functionalities in the game or not. Most of the users seemed to use most features in the game. Upgrade feature seemed to not be used much during the game, because all users were busy with shooting enemies. Moreover, some of the users did not see the health bar during the game. However, they became aware of all the features and used them after being told during testing.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Navigation (UX design)</h3></center>

				<p><strong>Alex</strong> – How can I go back to main menu when I play a single player mode? Do I have to die to get the main menu always? Other than this, the game was easy to use; I never got lost during it.</p>
				<p><strong>Jack</strong> – I found no problem when I’m playing the game.</p>
				<p><strong>Tim</strong> – I found it pretty straight forward.</p>
				<p><strong>Andy</strong> – It seemed relatively easy enough. I didn’t get lost when trying to do something.</p>
				<p><strong>Lina</strong> – I found it quite simple and intuitive.</p>
				<p><strong>Average Points</strong> – 0.2</p>
				<p><em>User feedback on navigation (Recommendations):</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>It is suggested that pause button or exit button should be created in the game. In that way, players can exit or pause any time they want</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>Observations:</em></p>
				<p>This test was designed to see whether users correctly use features and see the UX design is fluently working or not. All users had no problem with using the game, but only one person seemed to be frustrated, because he chose a wrong ship and start the game. Other than this, this test was successfully finished.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Sounds</h3></center>
				<p>Q. Do you think that the sound effects were appropriate?</p>

				<p><strong>Alex</strong> – Most sound effects were fairly well designed. Maybe change the background music when you are in the game mode. It kind of reminded me arcade games like Tetris.</p>
				<p><strong>Jack</strong> – Sounds were amazing, but too loud for me, even when the volume was low.</p>
				<p><strong>Tim</strong> – All sounds were good to me.</p>
				<p><strong>Andy</strong> – Great sounds, but I was annoyed by the sounds.</p>
				<p><strong>Lina</strong> – I found that there was no music in the main menu. Where is it?</p>
				<p><strong>Average Points</strong> – 1</p>
				<p><em>User feedback on sounds (Recommendations):</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Add background music in the main menu</li>
					<li>Add explosion sound effects e.g. when enemies die</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>Observations:</em></p>
				<p>This test was designed to see whether sound effects are appropriate for all users or not. For example, does it remind you of a space game? The end results were finished positively. One of users took off the headphones after the first time playing. Moreover, other users check the volume of the sound in the main menu. The users heard the rest of sound effects and had no problem with them.</p>
				
				<center><h3 class="title" >Summary</h3></center>
				<p>This user evaluation report has documented the hidden discoveries from the following methods.</p>
				<p>User evaluation test has been examined by four different methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Compatibility</li>
					<li>Functionality of game</li>
					<li>Navigation (UX design)</li>
					<li>Sounds</li>
				</ul>
				<p>According to these methods, the feedback has been fairly positive. Furthermore, the product has benefited significantly from these tests and recommendations from testers. Since all users/testers had different experience with playing game, we were able to receive various opinions and feedback suggestions from them. As a result, the game now covers a variety of people. </p>
